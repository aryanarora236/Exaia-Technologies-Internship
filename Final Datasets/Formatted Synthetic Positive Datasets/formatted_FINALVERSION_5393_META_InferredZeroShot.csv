Lately, I've been making these simple wallets as a way to unwind after a long day of designing. It's amazing how much focus and patience it requires – kind of like the mindfulness I've learned to cultivate at those Zoom meetings. Anyway, has anyone tried using edge bevelers on veg-tanned leather?",en

We ended up exploring Alfama afterwards and found this adorable little cafe that served the best pastéis de nata I've ever had.",en
3_1,3,1,bipolar,"The Temple of Edfu is seriously underrated – it's like stepping into an ancient Disney set, minus the FastPass lines. I was blown away by the intricate carvings and hieroglyphics that still manage to tell stories thousands of years later. Our guide, Amr, was incredibly passionate about sharing his knowledge, and you could feel the pride he had for his country's rich history.",en

I'm still reeling from the drama that went down at my workplace yesterday - one tiny mistake and suddenly everyone's an expert on how I should do my job. It's hard not to take it personally when people are ripping you apart online. Anyway, just wanted to vent to fellow crafty folks who know what it's like to be misunderstood; my therapist says I need to focus on self-care, so maybe I'll channel my frustration into a new cosplay project instead.",en

It's amazing how something as simple as a desktop theme can affect my mood and productivity. Right now, I'm loving the MATE desktop environment; it's so intuitive and easy to use, even on my older hardware.

Researching quantum entanglements, I've stumbled upon fascinating parallels between the show's supernatural realms and real-life theories on parallel universes.

Had a friend basically tell me I was being dramatic and childish the other day, and it really got under my skin - made me realize how often I still crave approval from people who don't even matter. Felt like I was 12 again, trying to fit in with the cool kids. Fiji's turquoise waters are calling my name, just want to escape this feeling of inadequacy for a bit.",en
15_1,15,1,bipolar,"Dating sims are so unrealistic, right? They make it seem like older partners care about personality and shared values, but in reality, they just want someone young and moldable. I've seen it time and time again with my clients - the guys who claim to be looking for a deep connection, but end up swiping right on anyone under 25.

Anyone know of any awesome projects or scripts that need a voice?",en
17_1,17,1,bipolar,"The way Nabokov illustrates Humbert's warped worldview through his writing style is eerily reminiscent of how I approach sketching a scene - it's all about perspective manipulation. The subtle tweaks in line weight, value, and composition can drastically alter the narrative, just like Humbert's twisted logic rewrites reality to justify his depraved desires. It's fascinating (and unsettling) to see how art can mirror the darker aspects of human nature.",en

20_1,20,1,bipolar,"The tactile bump on my keyboard is like a gentle reminder to stay grounded in my own agency - it's easy to get caught up in the hive mind, but at the end of the day, I'm the one who has to live with my choices. It's a lesson I learned the hard way, after realizing that blind obedience wasn't doing me any favors. Now, I'm all about embracing my individuality and taking ownership of my decisions - and my keyboard is a small but satisfying symbol of that independence.",en
21_1,21,1,bipolar,"Commander-in-chief's orders are just words on paper when the fabric of society is already unraveling at the seams. I've seen my fair share of combat, and the thought of a potential civil war breaking out in this country doesn't faze me as much as it probably should. We're already divided, we're already fighting - what's the difference if it's with guns or just vicious online rhetoric?

As someone who's super into fitness, I've tried every fad diet under the sun but nothing has given me the same level of control and understanding of my body as tracking my macros.

I've been listening to his 5th non-stop since I got my new stomach injections, and it's like the music is coursing through my veins alongside the insulin.

30_1,30,1,bipolar,"My girlfriend's got a killer eye for interior design and convinced me to let her decorate my office with these stunning handmade quilts. Now, I'm not gonna lie, the real showstoppers are the models she hired to ""accidentally"" drop by during business hours - nothing like having a few gorgeous women lounging on the couch, sipping lattes, and admiring the stitching to make an impression on potential investors.",en
31_1,31,1,bipolar,"Iceland's sparse population and rugged landscape make it an unlikely hub for INTJs, but I'm fascinated by the potential for a niche community to thrive in Reykjavik. Grand Rapids' own gay scene is surprisingly vibrant, and I've noticed a growing number of INTJs drawn to our city's laid-back Midwestern charm. If Iceland can offer a similar blend of acceptance and anonymity, it might just become a hotspot for like-minded individuals seeking a unique sense of belonging. The country's stunning natural beauty wouldn't hurt, either.",en

48_1,48,1,bipolar,"The 2016 Warriors are still the most fascinating team to analyze from a strategic standpoint - their pace-and-space offense was so far ahead of its time, it's crazy they didn't win more titles. I've been rewatching some old games and it's amazing how often they'd get Curry or Thompson open looks simply by exploiting defensive rotations. That said, I think the 2014 Spurs would've given them a serious run for their money in the Finals - Kawhi was already a force to be reckoned with back then.",en
